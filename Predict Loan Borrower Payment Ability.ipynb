    "# Predict Borrower Worthiness with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off its loan on time?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we are going to be using a data set provided by the lendingclub https://www.lendingclub.com/. The Lendingsclub is a match-making website for borrowers and lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lenders willingly provide loans to borrowers, nevertheless, there is always a risk that this latter won't be able to repay. Yet, the higher the risk, the higher the interest being paid, i.e. the money made for the lender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting credit-worthiness, will enable lenders to find the sweet spot between risk and return.\n",
    "\n",
