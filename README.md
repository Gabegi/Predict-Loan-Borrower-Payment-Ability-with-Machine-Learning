# Project Introduction

Python AI Project to predict Borrower Worthiness with Machine Learning using Pandas and Numpy packages

## Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off its loan on time?

To answer this question, we are going to be using a data set provided by the lendingclub https://www.lendingclub.com/. The Lendingsclub is a match-making website for borrowers and lenders.

Lenders willingly provide loans to borrowers, nevertheless, there is always a risk that this latter won't be able to repay. Yet, the higher the risk, the higher the interest being paid, i.e. the money made for the lender.

Predicting credit-worthiness, will enable lenders to find the sweet spot between risk and return.

The dataset covers the Lending Club 2007-2011 Data - one can get the dataset on Kaggle via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/samaxtech/lending-club-20072011-data/data
